**Generating CT Scan Representations from 4D CT** 
<br /> In radiation therapy, both for treatment planning and quality assurance procedures in thoracic regions, a 3D representation of a 4D CT scan can be generated. These scans can be utilised for diagnostic, delinieations and treatment purposes. Among the various multiplanar reconstructed scans, the three most prominently used are the Average Intensity Projection (AIP), the Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP), and the Minimum Intensity Projection (MinIP). In the 4DCT pre processing all of the above CT scan representations are generated.

<br />  <strong>AIP</strong> : Displays the average attenuation of all voxels of the index.
<br />   <strong>MIP</strong>  : Displays the voxel with highest attenuation of the index.
<br />   <strong>MinIP</strong> : Displays the voxel with minimum attenuation of the index.
